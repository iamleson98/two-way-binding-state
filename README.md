# two-way-binding-state key benefit
1: make communication between react components easier
2: create seperate state store for your component you want (not like redux, all state in one place)
3: state recalsulation run asynchronously, or can be delayed after a duration
4: React itself is one-way binding store, with this you can make two-way binding store
